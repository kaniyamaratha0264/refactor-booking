Do at least ONE of the following tasks: refactor is mandatory. Write tests is optional, will be good bonus to see it. 
Please do not invest more than 2-4 hours on this.
Upload your results to a Github repo, for easier sharing and reviewing.

Thank you and good luck!



Code to refactor
=================
1) app/Http/Controllers/BookingController.php
2) app/Repository/BookingRepository.php

Code to write tests (optional)
=====================
3) App/Helpers/TeHelper.php method willExpireAt
4) App/Repository/UserRepository.php, method createOrUpdate


----------------------------

What I expect in your repo:

X. A readme with:   Your thoughts about the code. What makes it amazing code. Or what makes it ok code. Or what makes it terrible code. How would you have done it. Thoughts on formatting, structure, logic.. The more details that you can provide about the code (what's terrible about it or/and what is good about it) the easier for us to assess your coding style, mentality etc

And 

Y.  Refactor it if you feel it needs refactoring. The more love you put into it. The easier for us to asses your thoughts, code principles etc


IMPORTANT: Make two commits. First commit with original code. Second with your refactor so we can easily trace changes. 


NB: you do not need to set up the code on local and make the web app run. It will not run as its not a complete web app. This is purely to assess you thoughts about code, formatting, logic etc


===== So expected output is a GitHub link with either =====

1. Readme described above (point X above) + refactored code 
OR
2. Readme described above (point X above) + refactored core + a unit test of the code that we have sent

Thank you!



============================================================================

1. Readme described above (point X above) + refactored code 
Improvements and Suggestions:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Use Laravel's Auth facade instead of $this->__authenticatedUser
2. Handle unauthorized access or missing parameters
3. Use of Null Coalescing Operator: Utilized the null coalescing operator (??) to provide default values for variables where appropriate.
4. Validation : Use the validation wherever required.
5. Reduced Cyclomatic Complexity: Reduced the complexity of some methods by removing nested conditionals.
6. Variable Naming: Renamed variables for clarity and consistency.
7. Error Handling: Improved error handling in the resendSMSNotifications method by catching exceptions and providing meaningful responses.
8. Use specific response codes like 500 for internal server errors
9. Reduced Duplication: Removed unnecessary duplication of code, especially in condition checking.
10. Remove the unnecessary commented code which will not be in use ever.
